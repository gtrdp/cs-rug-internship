abstract = {User location is a valuable contextual information in context-aware computing systems. These systems need to know the user's current physical location in order to provide relevant services. The location of mobile users can be inferred by measuring the received signal strength. This article presents a specific module of an agent-based framework - the Location Agent Module - which was developed for context-aware applications using the existing wireless network infrastructure: WiFi, Bluetooth and ZigBee. Furthermore, we present a comparison study with a quality of service (QoS) sub-module. The experimental results indicate that the ANN accuracy was 72{\%}, 63{\%} and 67{\%} using WiFi, Bluetooth and ZigBee protocols, respectively. Considering the use of QoS sub-module, we had an increase from 11{\%} to 21{\%} in the results with the three protocols, increasing the accuracy to 89{\%} to WiFi, 74{\%} to Bluetooth and 88{\%} to ZigBee. Based on the promising results achieved, we consider our approach adequate for indoor localization.},

abstract = {Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Network (IVWSN) is a new automotive architecture that applies wireless technologies to the communications between Electrical Control Units (ECUs) and sensors. It can potentially help achieve better fuel economy, reduce wiring complexity, and support additional new applications. In the existing works, most of the popular wireless technologies applied on IVWSNs occupy the same 2.4 GHz ISM frequency bands as WiFi and Bluetooth do. It is therefore essential to evaluate the performance of IVWSNs under interference from WiFi and Bluetooth devices, especially when these devices are inside the vehicle. In this paper, we report the results of a comprehensive experimental study of IVWSNs based on ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy under WiFi and Bluetooth interference. The impact of the interference from Bluetooth and WiFi devices can be clearly observed from the experiments. The results of the experiments conducted suggest that Bluetooth Low Energy technology outperforms ZigBee technology in the context of IVWSNs when WiFi interference exists in the car.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of the Internet over the last decade has led to an increasing demand for high-speed, ubiquitous Internet access. Broadband wireless technologies are increasingly gaining popularity by the successful global deployment of the wireless personal area networks (Bluetooth-IEEE 802.15.1), wireless local area networks (WiFi- IEEE 802.lln), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WiMAX- IEEE 802.16). New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called "full mobility" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds. This paper presents the analogy of promising wireless technologies on different frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX. This paper is organised into four parts: part I describes the functionality and usage of Bluetooth in the wireless personal area networks, part II presents the WiFi- IEEE 802.1 In strategies for users considering higher-bandwidth alternatives to existing wireless personal area networks, part III discusses how the WiMAX is used as a current standard for Wireless data transmission tec-$\backslash$nhnology, which is optimized to deliver high, bursty data rates to mobile subscribers, and to support real-time multimedia and Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, and part-TV explores how these emerging Wireless technologies differ from one another.},

In smart phones, battery power capabilities are not keeping up with the advances in other technologies (e.g., processing and memory) and are rapidly becoming a concern, especially in view of the growth in usage of energy-hungry mobile multimedia streaming. The deficiency in battery power and the need for reduced energy consumption provides motivation for researchers to develop energy efficient techniques in order to manage the power consumption in next-generation wireless networks. As there is little analysis in the literature on the relationship between the wireless environment and the mobile device energy consumption, this paper investigates the impact of network-related factors (e.g., network load and signal quality level) on the power consumption of the mobile device in the context of video delivery. This paper analyzes the energy consumption of an Android device and the efficiency of the system in several scenarios while performing video delivery (over UDP or TCP) on an IEEE 802.11g network. The results show that the network load and the signal quality level have a combined significant impact on the energy consumption. This analysis can be further used when proposing energy efficient adaptive multimedia and handover mechanisms.},

This paper provides an in-depth experimental investigation of the per-frame energy consumption components in 802.11 Wireless LAN devices. To the best of our knowledge, our measurements are the first to unveil that a substantial fraction of energy consumption, hereafter descriptively named cross-factor, may be ascribed to each individual frame while it crosses the protocol/implementation stack (OS, driver, NIC). Our findings, summarized in a convenient new energy consumption model, contrast traditional models which either neglect or amortize such energy cost component in a fixed baseline cost, and raise the alert that, in some cases, conclusions drawn using traditional energy models may be fallacious.},

We find that 3G and GSM in- cur a high tail energy overhead because of lingering in high power states after completing a transfer. Based on these measurements, we develop a model for the energy consumed by network activity for each technology. Using this model, we develop TailEnder, a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. For appli- cations that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail, TailEnder schedules transfers so as to minimize the cumulative energy con- sumed while meeting user-specified deadlines. We show that the TailEnder scheduling algorithm is within a factor 2× of the optimal and show that any online algorithm can at best be within a factor 1.62× of the optimal. For applications like web search that can benefit from prefetching, TailEnder aggressively prefetches several times more data and improves user-specified response times while consuming less energy. We evaluate the benefits of TailEnder for three different case study applications—email, news feeds, and web search—based on real user logs and show significant reduction in energy consumption in each case. Experiments conducted on the mobile phone show that TailEnder can download 60{\%} more news feed updates and download search results for more than 50{\%} of web queries, compared to using the default policy.},

abstract = {The massive explosion of mobile applications with the ensuing data exchange over the cellular infrastructure is not only a blessing to the mobile user but also has a price in terms of regular discharging of the device battery. A big contributor to this energy consumption is the power hungry wireless network interface. We leverage a measurement kit to perform accurate physical energy consumption measurements in a third generation (3G) telecommunication modem thus isolating the energy footprint of data transfers as opposed to other mobile phone-based measurement studies. Using the measurement kit we show how the statically configured network parameters, i.e., channel switch timers, and buffer thresholds, in addition to the transfer data pattern and the radio coverage, impact the communication energy footprint. We then demonstrate that being aware of static network parameters creates room for energy savings. This is done by devising a set of algorithms that (a) infer the network parameters efficiently, and (b) use the parameters in a new packet scheduler in the device. The combined regime is shown to transfer background uplink data, from real world traces of Facebook and Skype, with significant energy saving compared to the state-of-the-art.},

From a simple device for voice communication, it became a full blown multimedia device with multiple features and appealing services. In parallel with the introduction of novel services, mobile devices became more and more energy-hungry reducing the operational time for the user. To extend the battery life of mobile phones is one of the top priorities for mobile phones' manufacturers. This paper presents results of power and energy consumption measurements conducted on mobile phones for 2G and 3G networks. The services under investigation were text messaging, voice and data. The paper reports larger energy consumption in 3G networks for text messaging and voice services than energy consumption in 2G networks. On the other side the 3G networks become more energy friendly when large volumes of data have to be downloaded. The results imply that mobile phones should switch the network in dependency of the service used to save the maximum amount of energy. As this handover consumes energy, we include its analysis in our measurements.},

The objective is to maximize the user QoS allowing the mobile to switch from a network to the other, with the so-called vertical handover. The basic idea is to activate the vertical handover, not on the basis of the received power level, but by the crossing of thresholds defined by the user profile, which comprises objective values for parameters such as the packet error rate and the packet delay. The results show that the use of the vertical handover procedure can lead to an improvement in the QoS parameters},

In this paper, we propose to combine an ensemble of available sources of RF signals to build multi-modal signal maps that can be used for localization or for network deployment optimization. We primarily rely on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which provides a solution to the challenge of building a map of observations without knowing the location of the observer. SLAM has recently been extended to incorporate signal strength from WiFi in the so-called WiFi-SLAM. In parallel to WiFi-SLAM, other localization algorithms have been developed that exploit the inertial motion sensors and a known map of either WiFi RSS or of magnetic field magnitude. In our study, we use all the measurements that can be acquired by an off-the-shelf smartphone and crowd-source the data collection from several experimenters walking freely through a building, collecting time-stamped WiFi and Bluetooth RSS, 4G LTE RSRP, magnetic field magnitude, GPS reference points when outdoors, Near-Field Communication (NFC) readings at specific landmarks and pedestrian dead reckoning based on inertial data. We resolve the location of all the users using a modified version of Graph-SLAM optimization of the users poses with a collection of absolute location and pairwise constraints that incorporates multi-modal signal similarity. We demonstrate that we can recover the user positions and thus simultaneously generate dense signal maps for each WiFi access point and 4G LTE small cell, “from the pocket”. Finally, we demonstrate the localization performance using selected single modalities, such as only - iFi and the WiFi signal maps that we generated.},

abstract = {Recent research in ubiquitous and mobile computing uses mobile phones and wearable accelerometers to monitor individuals' physical activities for personalized and proactive health care. The goal of this project is to measure and reduce the energy demand placed on mobile phones that monitor individuals' physical activities for extended periods of time with limited access to battery recharging and mobile phone reception. Many issues must be addressed before mobile phones become a viable platform for remote health monitoring, including: security, reliability, privacy, and, most importantly, energy. Mobile phones are battery-operated, making energy a critical resource that must be carefully managed to ensure the longest running time before the battery is depleted. In a sense, all other issues are secondary, since the mobile phone will simply not function without energy. In this project, we therefore focus on understanding the energy consumption of a mobile phone that runs MIT wockets, physical activity monitoring applications, and consider ways to reduce its energy consumption.},

abstract = {Mobile phones nowadays are equipped with multiradio interfaces which allow radio link connections to an array of wireless networks. The presence of these interfaces however, introduces serious concerns. These interfaces consume huge amounts of energy thus can quickly drain their batteries and reduce the length of usage of the mobile phones. In this paper, a new activation service is proposed to reduce the energy consumption in mobile phones. The basic idea behind this proposal is to introduce an auxiliary receiver that is able to receive a special signal from the access point and activate the wireless interfaces on the mobile phone. During idle times, the wireless interfaces are switched off to reduce its idle power {\&}{\#}x2014; the energy a device consumes in {\&}{\#}x2018;standby{\&}{\#}x2019; state. When call or data arrives, the auxiliary receiver will receive notification from an access point and activate the relevant wireless interface on the mobile phone to receive the data or call. Through this activation service, we believe that power consumption can be reduced thus increase the longevity of mobile phone usage.},
