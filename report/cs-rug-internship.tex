\maketitle
Smart building has been an interesting topic of research recently. One portion of research in smart home is occupancy detection, which aims to detect whether a person is present in a particular location. Its importance to detect user presence is crucial in the building energy management, since the building can manage energy allocation efficiently regarding how many persons are present.

Several methods have been proposed to overcome the occupancy detection. One of them makes use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon, as the beacon is useful because it always transmitting a unique data packet that indicates certain location information. Assuming that the users always bring mobile phone with them, an application can be installed on the mobile phone to scan a particular beacon, so that the application knows where currently the user is, then the application sends the data to the central server. The data can be analyzed later on to detect user presence.

Normally, the application sends the data to the server through HTTP communication done via Wi-Fi connectivity, as the BLE is already used to sense the beacon. No BLE utilization for data transmission to the server has been found. In fact, BLE is obviously more energy efficient compared to WiFi, as BLE is designed to be implemented in devices coupled with limited source of energy, e.g., battery.

% how this study is positioned.
This study tries to investigate BLE utilization for transmitting the occupancy data to the server. This study measures and compares the energy consumption of the mobile phone when performing data transmission via WiFif and BLE. A tailored application is developed and several possible scenario is also taken into consideration, such as number of detected sensor and user location relative to the server or access point. The result of this study may be useful for the future decision whether BLE will be implemented instead of WiFi to transmit occupancy data to the server.

\section{Methodology} % (fold)
\label{sec:methodology}
As a term project, this study was performed in three consecutive months. The main part of this study, the energy measurement, was carried out in iPhone 6, which runs iOS operating system. Additionally, Asus vivo mini PC, which runs Xubuntu as its operating system, was also utilized as a thin client that hosts the server application.

\subsection{System Architecture} % (fold)
\label{sub:system_architecture}
This study is based on a study from Azkario, which attempts to extract occupancy data in smart building. This system consist of BLE beacons, which are placed accordingly in each room, a user's mobile phone, and a sensing infrastructure, which consists of WiFi infrastructure and sensing server. Currently, the user's mobile phone uses HTTP over WiFi to send occupancy data to the server, while Bluetooth is only used in mobile phone to or from BLE beacons. The Bluetooth communication in this study is intended to replace the mobile phone to server that is currently implemented using HTTP over WiFi. Briefly, the system architecture is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:system-architecture}. 

% To-Do add the sensing infrastructure on the right hand side
% add color as well, to the thin client
% add a dashed box to indicate where does this study reside
\begin{figure}
  \caption{System architecture overview.}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{system-architecture}
  \label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:system-architecture}, the thin client (colored in red), which acts as BLE central, is added to the Azkario's architecture. Later, energy consumption between BLE and WiFi are measured and compared. Although the result may be obvious that BLE is more energy efficient than HTTP over WiFi communication, this study aims to figure out how efficient is BLE communication compared to HTTP over WiFi in this context.

This study only focuses on mobile phone (iPhone) to WiFi Access Point (for HTTP over WiFi) or Thin Client (for BLE communication) for energy consumption measurement, which is surrounded in dashed box. The sensing part of the whole architecture, which is from beacons to iPhone, is neglected. As a consequences, dummy data that imitates the real data from beacons is used, which is sent from the mobile phone in every second.
% subsection system_architecture (end)

\subsection{Measuring the Energy Consumption} % (fold)
\label{sub:tracing_}
Energy consumption measurement or tracing is the core of this study. It is done by using untethered energy logging in iOS, in which the energy consumption data is logged internally in the device itself before imported to the computer by using cable connection. This method is selected because it has the flexibility over the other methods. Wireless logging, which does not involve internal logging in the device, is not used as it requires Bonjour enabled router that was unavailable.

% how to measure
Apple's Instrument application in Mac OS X was used to import the logged energy measurement in iPhone, as done in~\cite{Conte2014}. It does not show the measurement result in standard energy measurement format, e.g., mAh, but it shows that in its own format, which is scaled from 0 to 20. Each increment in the scale costs an hour of battery life~\cite{Lucchesi2014}. Thus, phone running at level 1/20 will have 20 hours of battery life, while phone running at level 20/20 will have only 1 hour of battery life.

Furthermore, export feature is limited in Apple's Instrument, i.e., it does not support energy consumption log exporting to other commonly used format, e.g., csv or xls file. However, manual copying and pasting on each row is still supported. An Apple script was used to automate the copying and pasting the energy log to Excel for further processing. However, it was also not stable. It encountered several errors during its runtime, which were caused by OS instability, and restarting the process was only way to overcome that.
% probably put a pseudo code, if it has some logic

\subsubsection{Measurement Parameters} % (fold)
\label{ssub:measurement_parameters}
% what are the parameters? and why?
Some parameters were selected for measuring energy consumption, which are number of beacon and distance of communication. Three number of beacons are selected, which are 5, 10, and 20, because five beacons are the most common number of beacon sensed in real case, while 10 and 20 are the double size of it. Distance of communication is divided into two category, Line of Sight (LoS) and non-LoS. Each of category has three distance. The set up of the measurement experiment is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-map}.

\begin{figure}
  \caption{iPhone placement map.}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{experiment-map}
  \label{fig:experiment-map}
\end{figure}

% where was it carried out?
The experiment was carried out in a Planetenlaan flat, Groningen, which has a living/bedroom, a kitchen, a toilet and shower room, and a storage room, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-map}. The WiFi Access Point and the thin client is located in the right of the apartment next to the wall. There are seven positions of measurement in this case, in which even number indicates non-LoS, e.g., 2, 4, and 6, while odd number indicates LoS, e.g., 1, 3, and 5. The last position, 7, is added to measure the effect when the mobile phone is located outside the apartment. During the experiment, energy consumption is recorded when the mobile phone is positioned to each of the locations. Each experiment is measured in 3 minutes time interval.

% at mobile phone, what was done
At the time of experiment, flight mode was turned on to hinder Mobile data connection that may possibly affect energy consumption.  Background application may affect energy measuring result. Background App refresh in iOS is also disabled to prevent significant impact of background processes. When measuring WiFi communication, the Internet on the WiFi Access Point is disabled to prevent any running background application from fetching data from Internet through WiFi connection. Furthermore, only one means of communication is turned on during experiment, i.e., when recording HTTP over WiFi communication, WiFi is switched on and Bluetooth is switched off and vice versa.

\subsection{Tailored Application Development} % (fold)
\label{sub:tailored_application_development}
Explain a bit about why an tailored application was used, compared with other research that used standard email, browsing, etc.
Because we would like to test specifically for smart home application, with Azkario's architecture.

Changed raw username (utf8) to userid (UInt32)
Changed proximity type from Double to Float
Added random label to indicate a particular timestamp for a ceratain data packet

The application is written in Swift, which is the new general-purpose programming language developed by Apple Inc. Xcode, with Storyboard, is used to develop the application, with Git as the source code repository.

A dummy occupancy data is sent to the server, as this study imitates the real implementation of user occupancy but not necessarily involves the sensing part.

History is also saved using NSCoding in iOS.

\subsubsection{BLE Communication Scheme} % (fold)
\label{ssub:ble_communication_scheme}
Bluetooth communication.
Explain a bit about BLE communication scheme.
And alleges that this study use subscription/notification method.

Initially Ian Harvey's bluepy library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy}}, which is a Python interface to Bluetooth LE on Linux, was used. However, it turned out that it does not work to handle the notification in BLE.

Later on, Sandeep Mistry's noble\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble}}, a node.js BLE central module, was used. It turned out that it is capable to handle notification scheme in BLE communication.

iOS only supports BLE communication using central-peripheral communication scheme. It does not support classic Bluetooth communication.

In Swift, the OS is not responsible to handle unsuccessful packet data transmission, the application itself must be aware to handle packet data transmission failure.

Explain BLE 20 bytes of packet size policy, and explain how those packets are implemented. Cite specification of bluetooth and john abraham.

Bluetooth in noble is turned out to be unstable, it always loses connection when it reached 29th data packet. As a solution, the central application always reconnect to the peripheral when disconnected.

Bluetooth connection requires manual trigger to start scanning nearby BLE devices. In order to do the experiment efficiently, beside SSH server that is used to access the thin client remotely. 

History is also saved using NSCoding in iOS.

  \label{fig:baseline-ble-wifi}
\end{figure}

Explain in detail first, separately for bluetooth and wifi.
Then explain the comparison of bluetooth and wifi and the baseline.

Time to send each BLE packet in this case is around 4ms. If the number of sensor is more that the threshold, some data will be lost.

In the experiment, brightness was proven to be one of significant source of energy loss as it consumes much energy to light up the screen.

BLE device's battery can lasts up to 3 years. Thus, if the BLE device which has small mAh of power can last up to 3 years, a mobile phone which has way more power than that must be able to last longer.
The phone is transmitting the same amount of signal power regardless how far it is from the central -> there is no significant power consumption difference. If the central goes beyond the limit of BLE signal border, the communication simply un-do-able, i.e., the peripheral is not required to boost up the transmitting power to maintain the communication.
There is no API to change the transmitting power of BLE in swift (AFAIK).


The scanning that still needs human interaction
Energy reporting which is un-exportable.
Solution: Creating applescript to copy and paste from instruments to excel automatically.
The bluetooth is not stable:
It always stops at 29 packets -> solution: using resubscribing method.
It has to be triggered by GNOME (GUI) Bluetooth management tool.
Why it is unstable?
Is it because of noble?
This research is only energy consumption for sending data. Without sensing etc.
Explain, this may differ in the real implementation, as both bluetooth and wifi may be turned on. The result might be slightly different.
Limitation: only tested for iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.2.
% section results_and_discussion (end)

\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented that Bluetooth is more energy efficient than Wi-Fi.

Wifi may still be a consideration because usually mobilephone are also using wifi extensively.

Some drawbacks may persist if bluetooth is implemented, such as instability. Other implementation than what is impelemented here must be looked for.
