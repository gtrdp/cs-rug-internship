%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page

%% first page will be refused.

The rest of this report is structured as follows.

\section{Related Work} % (fold)
\label{sec:related_work}
cite all the related work properly that you base your own work on

discuss why it is relevant and what is similar or different to your own work
use images (from other papers) to illustrate the related work, credit the authors with a reference in the image caption

give details for each publication (authors, title, year, page numbers, publisher, publisher address (town); for articles volume and number and month; for things other than books, articles, or papers also the type of publication)

% section related_work (end)

% section methodology (end)

\section{Results and Discussions} % (fold)
\label{sec:results_and_discussion}
Explain in detail first, separately for bluetooth and wifi.
Then explain the comparison of bluetooth and wifi and the baseline.
% section results_and_discussion (end)

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented that Bluetooth is more energy efficient than Wi-Fi.

Wifi may still be a consideration because usually mobilephone are also using wifi extensively.
